		<h5>Current App Critique</h5>
		<p class="maincontent">There are three main problems of the app, lack of values the brand represents, the typography hierarchy and the grid.
		Since Lansinoh is a mom & baby product brand, it represents the important value of love, and relates with the emotions such as happiness, peacefulness, pride, etc. While in the app, only the color palette is compatible with the branding value. Users can hardly tell the branding value from other elements. The app design should strengthen Lansinohâ€™s branding image and it can be a great emotion carrier.
		The typography hierarchy represents the information structure of an app. A clear and logical use of typography (font and size) helps users understand an app better. While in the app, the typography hierarchy is not very clear or sometimes lack the hierarchy. So users are sometimes confused where they should focus their eyes or where they should start to read first.
		The grid also somehow represent the information structure. Additionally it has an e ect on the visual layout. For a mobile application it is important to follow grids.</p>
